                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>
                    To give you some inspiration, here are some examples readers have shared with me: “To inspire positive change through teaching and coaching.” “To create opportunities for today's youth.” “To encourage, engage, and equip others to believe in the possibilities.” “To positively impact the life of every person I meet.”

                <h3>Vission</h3>
                <p>
                    My vision for Bangladesh 2022 cannot but be the one visualised for the nation by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. This has to be an India which gives every citizen the opportunity and the means to realise his growth and potential, a country which is vibrant socially, economically and culturally.

                <p>
                    As in these competitive times to make my career stay strong in the world I must get an online software or solution which can be used by the customers. Hence in all, I must say web development is a sector which will grow instead of going out of style. And hence it is a great career field in 2022-23 and beyond.

                Web development is the process of building websites and applications for the internet, or for a private network known as an intranet. Web development is not concerned with the design of a website; rather, it's all about the coding and programming that powers the website's functionality.
                <br>
                <br>
                From the most simple, static web pages to social media platforms and apps, from e-commerce websites to content management systems (CMS); all the tools we use via the internet on a daily basis have been built by web developers.
